They offer competitive pricing together with an excellent level workmanship and the office back up to deal efficiently with the necessary paperwork for our projects. <br> The fashion in which each contract has been approached, paying attention to the necessary detail and always compliant with all health and safety responsibilities, recommends the continued use of KWB Building Services Limited for future projects.  </p>

          <p class="">Over the past few years, KWB Building Services have undertaken a number of renovation projects and interior fit outs for our family and friends.

          <p class="">Kevin and his team have done a great job on our apartment, sweating the details during months to transform it into our dream home. It was quite a challenging project involving structural work, complex woodwork, plumbing, etc. but everything has been achieved to a high degree of quality. We also ended up becoming friends with Kevin who is a very fun person to know.</p>

          <p class="">I have known KWB Building Services Limited <strong>(KWB)</strong> for almost two years. KWB fully renovated my two London rental flats. Both projects were delivered on time and on budget.  The work was completed to a very high standard.  The quality of the finish and attention to detail was exceptional.  Kevin provided excellent advice on design, colour schemes and fixtures and fittings.  The value of my properties has increased substantially as a result of KWBâ€™s high quality workmanship and finish.
